# EastArctica/dotfiles

Hi everyone! This is basic enough dotfiles setup. Mostly just misc things I prefer with a *little* rice thrown in there.

## To Do
- [ ] Implement patching system for submodules. (ex. swaylock config)
- [X] Add function for basic package installation
- [ ] Add function for aur package installation w/ aur helper of choice
- [ ] Implement basic package installation options. (ex. cliphist, wofi, wl-clipboard)
